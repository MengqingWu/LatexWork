% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{siunitx}

% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}

A new Large area x-Y COverage Readout Integrated Strip telescope (\lycoris) is being constructed
as an improvement of the DESY test beam infrastructure within the Horizon2020 AIDA-2020 project~\cite{aida2020}.
The \lycoris telescope consists of six layers of \SI{25}{\micro\metre} pitch strip Si sensor readout by two bump-bonded ASICs (KPiX),
running at a timing resolution as multiples of \SI{80}{\nano\second};
its active area is designed to be $10\times$\SI{10}{\square\centi\metre}, extendable to $10\times$\SI{20}{\square\centi\metre}.
It can run either standalone or be mounted inside a \SI{1}{\tesla} solenoid magnet,
providing a spatial resolution better than \SI{10}{\micro\metre} along the bending direction,
and a resolution better than \SI{1}{\milli\metre} along the magnetic field.
The full readout system was tested with a hexagonal pixel sensor designed for the SiD ECAL in the lab with a $^{90}$Sr source,
and later tested in the electron beam at DESY in May and October 2017. The first assembled modules with the final strip were tested in spring 2018.
First results of the \lycoris prototype will be presented with a comparison to simulation,
besides, the characterization of sensor and readout system are also included.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

The DESY II Test Beam Facility\cite{desytbf}
provides $e^-/e^+$ beams with energies from 1 to \SI{6}{\GeV} up to \SI{1}{\MHz}
%converted from bremsstrahlung beams from carbon fibre targets in the electron-positron synchrotron DESY II,
with three test beam lines (TB21, TB22 and TB24).
The beam lines TB21 and TB22 are both equipped with a EUDET-type beam telescope~\cite{eudet}
with an active area of around 1$\times$\SI{2}{\square\centi\metre},
which is based on a fine pitch \uppercase{mimosa}~26 monolithic sensor with an event readout frame of \SI{115.2}{\micro\second};
the beam line TB24 is equipped with a \SI{1}{\tesla} solenoid, the PCMAG, at a diametre of $\sim$\SI{85}{\centi\metre} with its wall of $\sim20X_0$,
inside which both the EUDET-type telescope and the Device Under Test (DUT) can be inserted.
The EUDET-type beam telescopes at DESY are proven to meet user demands very well and thus in a high ($\sim$70\%) demand,
however, its active area is limited for momentum measurements for users in the PCMAG or for users requiring a larger tracker coverage.
Therefore, a new telescope is in need to provide a spatial resolution better than \SI{10}{\micro\metre} along the bending direction,
and a resolution better than \SI{1}{\milli\metre} along the magnetic field,
with a large active area of 10$\times$10/\SI{20}{\square\centi\metre},
to cover 90\% to 96\% of the incoming particles with energies from 1 to \SI{6}{\GeV} considering momentum smearing after the magnet wall.

\subsection{Sensor}

The 10$\times$\SI{10}{\square\centi\metre} SiD tracker strip sensor at a pitch of \SI{25}{\micro\metre}, readout by two 1024-channel ASICs, KPiX~\cite{kpix}, can provide a resolution of around \SI{7.2}{\micro\metre},
was hence chosen, and the other requirements can be achieved by a \SI{2}{\degree} tilt. This sensor was originally developed for the SiD Detector Concept for the ILC~\cite{Behnke:2013lya}.
The new telescope, \lycoris is finally designed as a 6-plane strip telescope in a mirror symmetric setup, with its upstream orientation of (0, -\SI{2}{\degree}, \SI{2}{\degree}),
see Figure~\ref{fig:1figs} (left), and it is controlled by a custom FPGA board.
When a beam particle passes a Photomultiplier (PMT), the connected Trigger Logic Unit (TLU) will send a trigger to the telescope and to the DUT for synchronization;
the telescope data is digitized and readout by the bump-bonded KPiXs, then packed by the DAQ board and sent to the connected PC. A common DAQ software from the beam telescope
community, EUDAQ2~\cite{eudaq2}, is used, which helps to synchronize the run control of telescope, TLU, and DUT. It also greatly simplifies the integration of user DAQ systems.

The KPiX chip runs in a pulse cycle mode with a timing resolution as multiples of \SI{80}{\nano\second}, and it can record up to four events per cycle for each channel.
The KPiX readout system was characterized before the final strip sensor delivery with several hexagonal pixel sensors, which were originally designed for the SiD ECAL~\cite{Behnke:2013lya}
and are using the KPiX as well. These tests included understanding how to synchronize the KPiX chip data taking cycles to the DESY beam structure, as well as to other devices, like the TLU, and various DUTs.
It was tested first with a $^{90}$Sr source in the lab, and then in the DESY test beam with energies from 4 to \SI{6}{\GeV} in May and October 2017~\cite{lycoris1}.

The strip sensors were delivered by Hamamatsu in summer 2017, showing very good electric features and all fully depleted at around \SI{50}{\volt}, see Figure~\ref{fig:2figs} (left).
% The first assembled sensors, see one example in Figure~\ref{fig:1figs} (right), were tested in spring 2018, with a $^{90}$Sr source in the lab at DESY, and several DESY test beam weeks are in schedule in fall 2018.
% Figure~\ref{fig:2figs} (right) shows the fired strip distribution over one data taking run, collected by one KPiX chip in a self-trigger mode from one assembled module, using a $^{90}$Sr source ,
% demonstrating that the assembled module is capable of seeing signals.
The first assembled sensors were produced early spring 2018, then examined firstly in the lab, then moved to the DESY-II Testbream Facility for testing in the summer 2018.

The plateau at around 4 represents the maximum number of possible recorded events in one cycle for one strip, and the coresponding strips are positioned right beneath the $^{90}$Sr source;
the drop-off to the sides of the plateau results from the larger distance and angle from the source to the strips, i.e. a reduced number of registered $\beta$ particles.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure

% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].

% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or

\section{Conclusion}
% The \lycoris telescope is scheduled to be delivered early 2019, with a TLU and a reconstruction software ready-to-use for user.
% In this contribution, the \lycoris telescope will be presented, with its first results and a comparison to simulation;
% the characterization of the sensor and readout system will also be included.

This is the first application of the SiD hybrid-less micro-strip sensor, from which the sensor with its featured readout system are characterized systematically.
The very first assembled modules were examined with various run conditions in the lab, and the following features are verified:
1) 80-85\% readout channels shown good ADC to charge reponse, as well as relatively low noise (0.5 fC);
2) sensor is able to see signal out of noise under self-trigger mode, and locate the signal position.

The first beam test result not only confirms what has been verified in the lab, but also shows a lower noise (0.2 fC) with the sensor better shielded with the final support structure.
The external trigger run mode is first studied on this sensor at the test beam, which shows a promising signal to background ratio after pedestal subtraction;
signal efficiency is also firstly be tested under self-trigger mode with a timing conincidence to the external trigger,
